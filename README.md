# CrickTrack 🏏


CrickTrack is an in-progress iOS app designed to help cricket players analyze their match performance, emotions, and long-term progress.

## 🔧 What it does

- Log matches and outcomes (win/loss)
- Track runs, wickets, and mood (emoji-based)
- Display stats across formats (Test, ODI, T20)
- Visualize progress over time with Swift Charts

## 💡 Why I Built It

As a cricketer and aspiring CS student, I wanted to combine my love for the sport with my growing interest in app development. I started learning Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase during my 12th grade while also preparing for the SAT and JEE.

CrickTrack is a solo passion project I’ve been building from scratch, inspired by my real-life cricket experiences.
